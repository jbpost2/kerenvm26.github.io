## This is my first blog post about **data scientists** and _statisticians_  

I think that a **data scientist** is in charge of extracting the value of data and using it to make better decisions.  

The major duties that **data scientists** must have are collection, cleaning, processing, exploration, and visualization, as well as developing/training algorithms like machine learning.  

A **data scientist** should have knowledge areas such as statistics, computer science, domain knowledge, and communication, which enable them to achieve the major duties explained above.  

**Data scientists** and _statiscians_ can be considered similar careers because their duties can overlap each other, but I feel that the principal difference is in how the data is collected. 

**Data scientist** collects the data as it is, while _statiscians_ focuses on statistical theory, methods, and research to produce better experimental design and sampling techniques that allow the collection of meaningful data.

I find both of these careers to be extremely fascinating. Currently, I identify as a _statistician_ thanks to my doctoral program, and I am striving to do everything necessary to excel in this field. This includes pursuing an additional Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics and Data Management. My current Ph.D. focus is on designing research methodologies for market analysis, specifically in regard to consumer perception and behavior. I am committed to generating methodologies that ensure the collection of the most high-quality data that will provide valuable insights into the hygiene tissue industry for data-driven decision-making.
